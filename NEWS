jaxml NEWS:
===========

	3.02:   - support Python 2.7

        3.01:   - Small fix.
        
        3.00:   - Full support for XML namespaces added (see end of test program)
                - Named indentation levels, for easier use.
                
        2.24:   - Copyright strings changed.

        2.23:   - a typo caused a bug when _do_nothign() was called
                  in CGI scripts

        2.22:   - nothing is output when there's no content to output.

        2.21:   - the _updatemapping() method now returns the new mapping's
                  content.
                - a minor bug which prevented headers
                  to be kept correct when adding or multiplying documents
                  was corrected.
                - the copy module is not needed anymore.

        2.20:   - basic arithmetic operations can now be made on XML_document
                  instances, these constructs are now accepted:

                                firstdoc + seconddoc
                                seconddoc + firstdoc

                        Where firstdoc is an instance of XML_document
                        or one of its subclasses, and seconddoc is
                        either an instance of XML_document or one of
                        its subclasses or a string of text.

                        Nota Bene: This will not exactly concatenate the
                        two documents, instead the second one will be inserted
                        as plain text at the current position in the new one.
                        This may cause the indentation of the resulting document
                        looks bad.

                                yourdoc * intvalue
                                intvalue * yourdoc

                        Will repeat your document just like the * operator
                        works with strings of text.

                        Nota Bene: Since a multiplication is a big addition, same
                        remark as above.

                - an infinite loop problem occured when doing a dir(yourdoc),
                  it is now corrected, but as a consequences every method
                  name beginning with "__" can't be used as a tag name.
                  This shouldn't cause any problem, because tag names
                  beginning with "__" are probably a very bad idea, if allowed
                  at all.
                - an _updatemapping method was added to allow you to initialise
                  or update the internal mapping used for the new templating
                  facility.

        2.10:   - Docstrings added to the _TAGGED_document.Tag class.
                - The __repr__ method is now defined once for all.
                - You can now use yourdoc["something"] = "anotherthing"
                  to do powerful templating. See the test/test.py program
                  for details, but beware: documents are not real mappings.
                - Truth value can now be tested: returns false for empty
                  documents.

   2.00beta1:   - Now fully integrates the jahtml module's
                  functionnalities, providing access to
                  an HTML_document class and a CGI_document
                  class. WARNING: the API for what was in jahtml has
                  changed, you MUST modify your programs before removing
                  the old jahtml module.
                - The jahtml module is now considered as being obsolete.
                - includes templating facilities for the XML_document class
                  as well as for the HTML_document and CGI_document classes

        1.29:   - Rollback on certain "speed optimisations"
                - Needs cStringIO again.

        1.28:   - Numerous speed optimisations
                - Doesn't need the cStringIO module anymore

        1.27:   - Speed optimisation

        1.26:   - The notation for naming spaces was introduced:

                        doc.space.tag(...)

                will produce:

                        <space:tag>
                          ...
                        </space:tag>

        1.25:   - A new useful notation was introduced, you can now
                  do something like:

        doc.onetag("...", attr="yes").othertag().adnauseam("easy tag nesting")

        1.24:   - Tags that enclose nothing are now handled correctly,
                  see test/test.py for examples.
                - Calls to yourtag("Some text", dummy="DUMMY") will
                  now produce:

                        <yourtag dummy="DUMMY">Some text</yourtag>

                  instead of :

                        <yourtag dummy="DUMMY">
                          Some text
                        </yourtag>

                - Some changes to the test program to reflect the
                  new behaviour.

        1.23:   - Now the license is set in setup.py
                - Now the _output() method accepts None
                  as the file argument
                - Minor changes to the documentation

        1.22:   - small problem in the documentation

        1.21:   - small bug correction with empty text

        1.2 :   - Large scale speed optimisations. The test
                  program launched 5000 times is now 2.5 times
                  faster than the 1.1
                  See the file CREDITS for details

        1.1 :   - Now uses distutils as the installation method.
                - Documentation fixes, thanks to Kragen Sitaker.
