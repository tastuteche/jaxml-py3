<font color="##font_color##">This document shows how well work the
variables substitution method (the _template() method).

<br />
If you look at the source of this document, you will see that
the 'some_text' variable wasn't replaced ##some_text## with anything but instead,
put in a comment. That's because the calling program didn't pass this
variable to the _template() method.

<br />
Just below a variable is incuded in a comment but when it is replaced it will be put out
of the comment, just like in the Whiz package from Neale Pickett at the LANL:

<!-- ##another_variable## -->

<br />
Bye.
